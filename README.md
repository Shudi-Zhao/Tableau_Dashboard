# COVID-19 Tracker Dashboard

## Project Overview

This **Coronavirus Tracker Dashboard** is designed to provide users with a clear and insightful view of the spread of COVID-19 both within the U.S. and globally. Built using Tableau, this dashboard consolidates key metrics, allowing users to track trends, visualize the distribution of cases, and explore the impact of the virus in different regions.

## Project Goals

- Provide users with an intuitive and informative way to monitor the spread of COVID-19.
- Visualize COVID-19 case data at both U.S. state and global country levels.
- Highlight trends in new cases, recoveries, and fatalities over time.
- Help users understand the geographic spread of the virus with dynamic maps and graphs.

## Features

1. **Global Overview**: A comprehensive view of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and recoveries worldwide.
2. **U.S. Focused Analysis**: Detailed analysis of COVID-19 spread within the U.S. by state.
3. **Interactive Maps**: Clickable maps that allow users to explore specific regions and view COVID-19 statistics.
4. **Trend Analysis**: Time series visualizations showing the rise and fall of cases over time.
5. **Key Metrics**: Daily updated metrics such as total cases, new cases, recoveries, and fatalities.

## Data Source
